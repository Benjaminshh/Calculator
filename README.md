# Calculator
[Live Demo](https://benjaminshh.github.io/Calculator/)  

This project is the final project for The Odin Project's foundations course.

My design and functionality of the calculator is based on one that I own:

I have not implemented the modulo and square root operators as they were not required. (I may come back later though) 

Here are some aspects where I took inspiration from my real life calculator:

- Because my calculator only takes 8 digits, I decided that I would do something similar and only limit the screen to eight characters.  

- If the number gets too big, the final result will display, but it will not accept any inputs except the clear button. Again, my calculator 
does this as well.
